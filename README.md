# Wheel-of...--MEM-

A system of selecting sacrifices fairly and randomly.

#Description

The objective of this project is to create a system of selection of sacrifices fairly and randomly for the participants. Once a name appears on the wheel, it cannot appear again until the wheel is restarted. The user must have the option to view the list of participants, to add new participants, to delete them, and finally, the option to modify an already added participant. It has to be able to work on any device.
